# Water potability classification

First of all, a big **_Thank you_** to my colleague **Ayman Makhoukhi** for the collaboration on this project, since it is an academic project, that we did during our Bachelor in **`Data Science`**, and we had the opportunity to collaborate in such projects, in order to practice various approches of **`Machine Learning`** in making prediction models.

To solve this classification problem, we used the **`Decision tree` _classifier_**.

> _So, what is a decision tree classifier ?_

Briefly, this classifier is a `flowchart-like` structure in which each internal **`node`** represents a **`test`** on an attribute (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails), each **`branch`** represents the outcome of the test, and each **`leaf node`** represents a class label (decision taken after computing all attributes). The paths from root to leaf represent **`classification rules`**.

- ### Dataset Used :

In order to create this classifier, we need an _**Initial Data**_, first to train the model with it, and second to test its performance after training it, for that reason, the dataset chosen for this project, is from **`Kaggle.com`**.

- ### Steps :
For better understanding of the code, each step has a comment with it, to make it easier for you to follow along.
